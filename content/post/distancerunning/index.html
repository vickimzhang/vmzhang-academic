<p>When I was 10, my elementary school teacher encouraged me to join our school’s track-and-field team and Running Club. I never thought I was a fast runner, but I guess I enjoyed running around enough. That spring, I ran in the <a href="https://www.sciencefairs.ca/fun-run/">Science Fair Fun Run</a>, placing 2nd in my age category, and haven’t looked back since.</p>

<p>I typically run in the early mornings, which usually means running before the sun is even out during our cold Canadian winters, but also means chasing the sunrise during fall and spring. Each summer, I try to run in at least one race, picking the race based on timing and the cause. I track my runs with the <a href="https://www.nike.com/ca/nrc-app">Nike Run App</a>, and I am constantly building my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1NDVIqEN5BpWLTp6D3GlNI">“Run” playlist</a> to feature songs that are 170-180 BPM.</p>

<h3>To run or to not run?</h3>
<p>That is the question. Our endurance, bipedalism, and ability to sweat to cool down means that humans are one of the best long-distance running species. Running is involved in some capacity in all sports, and trains both physical and mental strength. For me especially, once I hit that runner’s high, I feel calm, confident and happy.</p>
<p>However, the jury is still out on how good running really is for your body. Distance running can be very harsh on your body, resulting in critically low sodium levels, vulnerable immune systems, joint and muscle inflammation and injuries, and heart risk. You can even argue that chasing that runner’s high is unhealthily obsessive.</p>
<p>But don’t forget the perks! A nice and easy job will improve health, and I get to see my city in fast motion. When training towards a running goal, I am also mentally and physically challenged. Joining a running club also means that I get to meet a lot of other running enthusiasts in my community and we mutually encourage each other from training to race day. And running in races means I can support local charities and causes while celebrating another race ran <a href="https://raceroster.com/events/2020/27499/sporting-life-10k-virtual-run">(like this race that helps send kids affected by childhood cancer to Camp Ooch!)</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to lose weight, get shredded, and can’t commit to hours of roadside running, I would recommend that you check out other sports (from table tennis to weight lifting, your options are almost unlimited). But, I would also really recommend giving running a go.</p>
