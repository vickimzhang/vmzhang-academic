title: I play table tennis!
subtitle: ''
summary: You may know of ping pong as a basement sport, but I have been playing table tennis (aka ping pong) competitively since I was 11. I have been involved in table tennis throughout high school and university, for which I have worn many hats.

<h2>University Competitive Level</h2>
<p>I competed for the University of Toronto’s table tennis team in my freshman and sophomore years, as part of the <a href="http://www.nctta.org/">National Collegiate Table Tennis Association</a> (NCTTA). In my first year, our team placed in the top 3 at the Divisional and Regional levels, qualifying for Nationals in Round Rock, Texas, where we were the top Canadian school, and placed 7th overall. In my second year, we placed as well and qualified for Nationals but were unable to attend due to exam schedule conflicts.</p>

<h3>Executive Roles</h3>
<p>I’ve been a part of the executive team for the <a href="http://utttc.sa.utoronto.ca/">U of T Table Tennis Club</a> (UTTTC) for four years and counting. I served as the Public Relations Officer in my second year, Vice President in my third year, and President in my fourth year and the first year of graduate school. UTTTC aims to promote recreational and competitive table tennis both on and off campus through tournaments, intramurals, coaching, intercollegiate competitions and events. As the president, I made important decisions regarding all aspects of the club, prepared and followed a detailed schedule of the club for an academic year, created and adhered to a budget, delegated duties among executive members and maintained communication with all executives to them in their role. I am currently serving as the Public Relations officer (again!) for the 2020-2021 year.</p>
