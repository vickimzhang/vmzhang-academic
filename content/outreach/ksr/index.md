[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) teaches foundational coding, and data science skills to researchers worldwide. As an certified Instructor, I teach and assist Carpentry workshops (to date: 1) to spread data literacy and programmatic skills both locally and globally. 

You can [request a workshop](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/workshop/) if you are interested in organizing workshops on data, software, or librarian coding skills. You can also find [lesson content here](https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-curriculum).
