### What’s the point of doing good science if you’re not communicating it to others?

Science outreach is essential in encouraging excitement and delivering educational updates in the sciences. Science literacy is more important than ever, and effective communication of the research that we do can greatly increase the general public’s interest, resulting in a more well-informed and knowledgeable society.
