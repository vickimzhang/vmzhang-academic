[Let's Talk Science](https://outreach.letstalkscience.ca/utm.html) (LTS) is an outreach program that connects educators with volunteers to bring meaningful learning experiences to schools and communities. I am a Site Coordinator for LTS at the University of Toronto Mississauga, where I develop learning kits, build and develop a  volunteer base, and connect classrooms and community groups with STEM events and workshops.

Given the COVID-19 situation, I am working with three other site coordinators to build and develop kits that are transferrable and accessible in virtual learning and teaching.

If you are an educator interested in our outreach events, fill out an [Activity Request Form](https://outreach.letstalkscience.ca/utm/contact-us/request-a-visit.html)!

If you are interested in volunteering with us to bring events to classes, [get involved here](https://outreach.letstalkscience.ca/utm/get-involved.html).
