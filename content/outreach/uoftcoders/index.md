The [University of Toronto Coders](https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/) is study group that shares coding skills and resources via workshops and events to the UofT community, for research,  teaching, and personal use. I am the admin on the Executive Council, as well as a contributor. As the admin, I am response for internal communications between the council and members, informing members of events, contacting instructors, and creating event postings for the website. As a contributor, I create, update, and deliver lessons in the form of ~40 minute workshops for various coding skills.
