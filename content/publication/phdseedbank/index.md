abstract: "Although relatively infrequent, invasions by non-native plants at high latitudes are increasingly recognized as an emerging problem. Churchill, MB, Canada is unusual as over 100 non-native species have been found in human-disturbed areas, making it an outlier amongst subarctic habitats. Although these non-native species have persisted almost exclusively within town, some occur in isolated locations throughout the local road network. Most of these non-native species have been observed in areas with a history of soil movement (e.g., for construction or road repairs), suggesting that they have been moved within the soil, likely either germinating from seeds or growing clonally from root and rhizome fragments. Using a greenhouse experiment, we found evidence that soils from human-disturbed sites can contain a substantial non-native seed bank. In particular, we grew a significantly higher number of non-native seedlings from translocated soils compared with uninvaded soils. These germinated non-native species are native to Europe but have widely invaded temperate regions. This study provides the first direct evidence that movement of seed-contaminated soil is a significant source of local non-native species spread. Future warming in Arctic regions may increase seed production of these species, leading to increased spread and persistence via contaminated soil."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
