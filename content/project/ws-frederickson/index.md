My second work-study was in the [Frederickson Lab](http://mutualism.ca/), where I primarily worked under [Anna Oâ€™Brien](https://annamobrien.wordpress.com/). I managed and provided care to over 120 isogenic and mixed duckweed cultures. Duckweed is an aquatic plant that plays host to microbes, and their interactions are complex. The duckweed cultures that I maintained were then used for several projects, including [this one](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/448951v1.full).
