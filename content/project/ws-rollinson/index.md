In the [Rollinson Lab](http://rollinson.eeb.utoronto.ca/), I was responsible for digitizing decades of turtle observations from Algonquin Park. Since 1972, reproduction data of Snapping Turtles, Painted Turtles, Wood Turtles and Blandingâ€™s Turtles have been collected. Data includes information on nesting behaviour, turtle hatching, growth, and more, and is valuable for investigating turtle life history. I interpreted and standardized observations, and entered it into a large database which comprised of decades of data.
