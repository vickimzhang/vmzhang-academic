Supervised by [David Punzalan](http://www.davidpunzalan.com/) and [Locke Rowe](https://rowe.eeb.utoronto.ca/), I investigated the distribution and future range shifts of two ambush bugs, Phymata americana and Phymata pennsylvanica. Stay tuned for a blog post on the results!

I created a minute-long and relatively jargon-free animated video to summarize some of the preliminary results using Powtoon. Check it out below:

I presented my results as a talk at the Toronto Entomology Associationâ€™s 2019 [Student Symposium](https://www.ontarioinsects.org/symposium/index.html), and as a poster at the 2019 Ontario Ecology, Ethology and Evolution Colloquium (OE3C) and the 2019 EEB Undergrad Poster Fair. I also presented this work at the 2020 IALE Annual Meeting as an [iPoster](https://2020toronto-ialena.ipostersessions.com/default.aspx?s=62-71-43-36-EE-35-05-B9-DB-A8-AC-79-F4-6E-2B-8B&guestview=true) (interactive and downloadable!).
