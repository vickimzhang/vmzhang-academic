I am a field ecologist and educator.

I just started a role as a Quantitative Ecologist with [ApexRMS](https://apexrms.com/), and I am excited to transition to applied ecological consulting and data science for conservation. Stay tuned!

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Kotanen Lab](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~w3pkota/) at the University of Toronto at Mississauga. For my graduate work, I am investigating the effect of human impacts on invasive species at the edge of the Canadian Arctic. Other current projects include: using statistics, data visualization, and mathematical modeling in R and Python for science communication; developing best practices for mentorship and pedagogy in university-level science courses, outreach, and research. 


I completed my Honour's Bachelor of Science in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto. My undergraduate thesis work was supervised by [Locke Rowe](https://rowe.eeb.utoronto.ca/) and [David Punzalan](https://www.davidpunzalan.com/), where I investigated the distributions and range shifts of two ambush bug species, _Phymata americana_ and _P. pennsylvanica_.


Apart from science, I do a lot of athletics, including [running]({{< ref "/post/distance-running/index.Rmd" >}}), paddling for the [Liquid Assets](https://www.liquidassetsdbt.com/) dragon boat team, and playing [table tennis]({{< ref "/post/tabletennis/index.Rmd" >}}). In my downtime, I also [read a lot](https://goodreads.com/vickithebookglutton).
